# ONNX: Open Neural Network Exchange

## Introduction
ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) is an open-source format designed to represent machine learning models. It provides a unified framework to interchange models between different platforms and frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, and more. By supporting interoperability, ONNX allows developers to leverage the strengths of various tools and hardware.

ONNX supports a variety of operators and provides tools for model optimization, making it a preferred choice for production deployment and real-time inference.
